What is NodeJs?

-Nodejs is JavaScript on the server.
-it is possible because nodejs uses the javascript engine to run all the JS code provided.


Why use NodeJS?

-It is event-driven.
-It uses none-blocking I/O (input/output) which makes it lightweight and more efficient.

Random JS note:

-synchronous vs asynchronous:

-synchronous code is excuted in sequence, each statement runs only after the previous one is excuted.

-asynchronous code does not wait, and the programn continues to run. It is good becuase it reduces wait time for the user.
